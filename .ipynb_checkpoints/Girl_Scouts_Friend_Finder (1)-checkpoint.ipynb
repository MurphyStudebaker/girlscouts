    "- **CoLab** is Google's online editor for writing coding notebooks like the one you're currently using. You can save this notebook to your own account, so you can make edits or take notes and save your changes. Eventually you can make a new notebook with your own data science models!\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature** is a measurable way to describe something or someone in your dataset. When working on a data science project, deciding what features are important to the model you are trying to build is a good first step. In many cases, choosing good features can be the difference between a good and a bad model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most features fall into one of the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Numerical Features**\n",
    "These are things that are represented naturally as numbers. With numerical features, you can compare two different records in your data set by seeing if these numerical features are less than, greater than, or equal to each other.  Some examples are things like:\n",
    "- the number of times you've seen Taylor Swift live in concert\n",
    "- how many states you have visited\n",
    "- how many pets you own\n",
    "- how many siblings you have\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bin Features**\n",
    "Bin features are similar to numerical features, but they allow you to specify a certain range (or \"bin\") of values to group numerical values together. This is often used for things like:\n",
    "- age range (1-12, 13-18, 18-24, 25+)\n",
    "- your astrological sign (bins of birth date ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **One-Hot Encoded Features**\n",
    "Categorical features are features that are not naturally represented numerically and usually represent some sort of category or description. Some examples are:\n",
    "- your favorite color (\"Blue\",\"Purple\",\"Orange\")\n",
    "- your favorite sport (\"Soccer\",\"Football\",\"Hockey\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It's much easier for a model to compare the meaning of two numbers than to compare the meaning of two words. We use a technique called one-hot encoding to transform descriptive features into numerical features, so we can perform mathematic calculations using the features later on. With one-hot encoding, we represent each potential option as its own column and then represent the selection of that category with a 1 or a 0. After encoding, we would have the following features:\n",
    "- color_green, color_purple, color_orange\n",
    "- sport_soccer, sport_football, sport_hockey\n"
