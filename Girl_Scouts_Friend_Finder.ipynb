In many cases, choosing good features can be the difference between a good and a bad model!\n",

We use a technique called one-hot encoding to transform descriptive features into numerical features, so we can perform mathematic calculations using the features later on. With one-hot encoding, we represent each potential option as its own column and then represent the selection of that category with a 1 or a 0. After encoding, we would have the following features:\n",
